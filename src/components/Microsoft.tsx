          Microsoft AI & Robotics Literacy Program – Empowering the Next Generation of Innovators
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          The Microsoft AI & Robotics Literacy Program is a year-round national initiative aimed at equipping Kenyan high school students with 21st-century skills in Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, coding, and digital fabrication.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Led by Microsoft Kenya in partnership with CHIPUROBO and eKitabu, the program delivers immersive, hands-on learning experiences that foster creativity, innovation, and real-world problem solving.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Program Goals – What This Program Is All About</h2>
        <p className="mb-8">
          The Microsoft AI & Robotics Program is here to help students and teachers learn about the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence (AI), robots, and how technology is changing the world around us. We want to make learning fun, hands-on, and practical — not just theory in books.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8 space-y-2">
          <li>💡 Students will understand how AI works and how it’s used in real life — like in robots, self-driving cars, or apps like ChatGPT.</li>
          <li>🤖 You’ll get to build and program your own robot, using sensors, motors, and even vision (like giving your robot “eyes”).</li>
          <li>🧠 You’ll learn how to write code in Python — one of the most popular programming languages used by engineers and scientists.</li>
          <li>🛠️ You’ll design and create parts using 3D printers and laser cutters, just like in real tech labs.</li>
          <li>👩‍🏫 Teachers will also learn how to teach AI in class, and how to support students to become future innovators.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-8">
          The big outcome? Students walk away with real skills in AI and robotics. You’ll have built something, coded something, and learned how these technologies can solve real-world problems. And teachers become champions who can guide more students in the future.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Confirmed April 2025 Cohort</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">The following schools have officially confirmed their participation in the upcoming workshop:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-8">
          <li>Starehe Girls Centre</li>
          <li>Starehe Boys Centre</li>
          <li>The Excellence School</li>
          <li>Moi Girls School Nairobi</li>
          <li>Limuru Girls High School</li>
          <li>Nairobi School</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mb-8">
          🏫 These schools were carefully pre-selected as part of the pilot phase of the Microsoft AI Literacy Program. Selection was guided by a mix of strategic factors:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8 space-y-2">
          <li>Strong STEM track record and demonstrated commitment to innovation</li>
          <li>Infrastructure readiness to support advanced robotics and AI activities</li>
          <li>Ongoing collaboration with Microsoft, CHIPUROBO, and eKitabu in past digital learning initiatives</li>
          <li>Geographic accessibility to the Microsoft ADC Garage in Westlands, Nairobi</li>
          <li>Diversity and inclusivity, ensuring representation across both national and county-level institutions, as well as gender-balanced student bodies</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-8">
          This pilot cohort sets the foundation for a larger, nationwide rollout. Insights and feedback from these initial schools will directly inform the program’s scale-up strategy throughout 2025 and beyond.
